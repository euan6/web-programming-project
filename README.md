# web-programming-project

My own web programming project for F28WP. In this project I will be contributing weekly towards building a website.

## Issues

On the 26/09/2023 I had to delete my main branch and re-commit the files due to an issue I had with the branches. Everything should be fixed now, however the number of commits only shows what I have just re-commited due to me changing branches for my project.

## Branches

On the 04/11/2023 a branch was created to merge the header and navigation bar into one file. This was done successfully and the Javascript and HTML was updated to reference the new file names and the change of the id name.
