# web-programming-project

My own web programming project for F28WP. In this project I will be contributing weekly towards building a website.

## Issues

On 26/09/2023 I had to delete my main branch and re-commit the files due to an issue I had with the branches. Everything should be fixed now, however the number of commits only shows what I have just re-commited due to me changing branches for my project.

## Branches

On 04/11/2023 a branch was created to merge the header and navigation bar into one file. This was done successfully and the Javascript and HTML was updated to reference the new file names and the change of the id name.
On 14/11/2023 a branch was created to add more functionality to the products displayed on my website. However the desired functionality was not met and therefore the changes were dismissed.

## Github Pages

On 21/11/2023 this repository was deployed as a Github page which is live at https://euan6.github.io/web-programming-project/
